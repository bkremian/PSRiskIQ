# Installation
You can clone this repository to manually import PSRiskIQ, or install from the **[PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSRiskIQ)**:\
`PS> Install-Module -Name PSRiskIQ`

Once installed, you can begin running PSRiskIQ commands once you `Import-Module -Name PSRiskIQ`.

## Requirements
Requires **[PowerShell 5.1+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)**

# Credentials
In order to interact with the RiskIQ APIs, you need a valid **[API Key and Secret](https://community.riskiq.com/settings)**.
If you have previously exported your credentials into `$Home\RiskIQ.cred`, they will be automatically imported
when you import the PSRiskIQ module from the `$Home` directory.

## Exporting Credentials
You can save your credentials using the `ExportCred()` method, which will prompt you for your Key (username)
and Secret (password). Once input, the credentials will be exported as `.\RiskIQ.cred`. If you move the
credentials to your home directory, they will be automatically imported when PSRiskIQ is loaded.

This exported file is designed to be used only by the user that created it, on the device that it was created on.
Attemping to copy this file to a different device or importing it into PSRiskIQ under a different user account
will fail. **[Learn more about encrypted credentials here](https://adamtheautomator.com/powershell-export-xml/#Saving_an_Encrypted_Credential)**.

```powershell
PS> $RiskIQ.ExportCred()
```
**WARNING**: This exported file is encrypted on Windows, but it is not encrypted on MacOS or Linux. Credential
handling in PSRiskIQ is provided for convenience and not security.

## Importing Credentials
You can rename these files to save different credential sets and import them using the `.ImportCred()`
method. When importing credentials you only need to specify the name of the file, as it will be imported from
the local path and default to using the `.cred` extension.

```powershell
PS> $RiskIQ.ImportCred('Example')
Imported Example.cred
```

# Usage
You can list all available commands through `Get-Module -Name PSRiskIQ` once the module has
been imported. Using the `-Help` parameter with any command will show the available parameters and
a brief description.
